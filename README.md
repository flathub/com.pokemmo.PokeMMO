# Wayland / X11 Support

Wayland and X11 are supported for Flatpak as-of Unix Launcher v3.0b.

Due to limitations with flatpak's support of display servers, you can not forcibly mix display server settings:
✅ Wayland on Wayland-enabled desktop environment
✅ X11 on X11-only desktop environment
❌ X11 on Wayland-enabled desktop environment— Only achievable if you modify permissions. This will fail to start with a "No available display compositors" error

# Steam Deck support

Support for Steam Deck / Steam OS is considered experimental and requires manual setup steps. Visit https://support.pokemmo.com/knowledgebase/article/steam-deck-setup for more information on how to set up the game client for Steam OS
